We are trying to build a full fledged fintech solution to consolidate all the user’s bank accounts in one app giving them a graphical analysis of their expenditure versus savings.
 
The CORE of our webapp is the AI Loan Prediction Model that we have incorporated in our webapp which takes the user’s financial data and curate a credit history for them further predicting if they are eligible for the loan or not.




There is a lack of a comprehensive fintech solution that consolidates users' multiple bank accounts into a unified platform with advanced analytics for visibility into financial data, spending patterns, and overall financial health. 

Existing loan prediction models fail to consider individual credit histories and financial habits, leading to inaccurate loan eligibility assessments. 

Furthermore, personalized financial planning tools that provide tailored budgeting, saving, and financial suggestions based on a user's unique financial situation are lacking.


There is a need for an intelligent, user-friendly application that integrates with open banking APIs to aggregate accounts, leverages AI-driven analytics for insightful data visualization, incorporates a sophisticated loan prediction model considering credit history, and offers personalized financial planning through NLP and generative AI analysis of spending habits and goals. Such a holistic solution would empower users with unprecedented financial control and represent a paradigm shift in personal finance management. To address these gaps, we cater you with Savify.
